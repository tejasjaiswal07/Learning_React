Q2 what is the difference between library and framework?

-- A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides a set of functions or methods that developers can use to perform specific tasks or 
solve specific problems. Developers can choose which specific parts of the library they want to use in their own code and integrate them accordingly.

In contrast, a framework is a more comprehensive set of pre-written code that provides a structure or architecture for developing an entire software application.
Developers must build their application on top of the framework and follow its rules and conventions, which can make it more prescriptive but also potentially more
powerful and efficient.
